List of files
---

test1,test2,test3

What the files contain
---

test1 contains a header and 3 inputs for id, parking spot number and time of arrival without a widget. (with a placeholder that direct the user on the way to write the date and time)

test 2 contains the same header and 3 inputs but a try to use a widget with bootstrap 4 that didn't work.

test3 contains the same things that i mentioned in test 1 and 2 but this time i tried to use the widget with bootstrap 3 and it did work.  

How to run those files 
---
i used the bootstrap libarary as you told me so i guess that you need to download it for it to work but i am not sure, beside that for the widget i used the html template from this [link](https://tarruda.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/) under the title comelete sample markup.

Bugs that i still need to fix
---

for now as you saw the widget works fine with bootstrap 3 atlist on my machine but i couldn't make it work yet with bootstrap 4, tell me if you think its imporatant to use bootstrap 4.  it seems that some lines of code there interfere with the widget, though i don't know what to do about it yet. 

Future ideas
---
i think i need to add another input to help the user enter the end date and hour of his stay (i will do it soon) and then write some lines of javascript in order to use those inputs to do something. it wasn't mentioned in the issue what exactly i should do with those inputs so i didn't do anything with javascript yet.
